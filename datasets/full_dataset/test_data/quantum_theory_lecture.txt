I'm going to give you directly the solution, but the way you solve that is by iteration.
Okay, so you can first put the first solution and then iterate,
and it will give you the notion of time-order exponential.
Where here, I'm going to use this arrow to make explicit the time order,
and I'm going to write explicitly what it is.
So here it starts from t0 to t, and so what is that?
This denotes the left to right logical ordering of the-
So here, because t now, h depends on t, the sequence of h of t for different t is not going to commute anymore, okay?
Sequence of operator-
So are you familiar with this? So I'm going to write explicitly what it is, but are you familiar with that or not?
and do you know how to find- are you able to prove that this is indeed at least the first step?
That this is a solution starting from here or not?
Not really. Not really, yeah. Okay, so maybe I'm going to add for our next tutorial a problem on that.
So of course, people that are super familiar with that, you can skip it, and the other, you can do it step by step, and at least think about it 
So you're going to see this kind of definition often, so that's good if at least you have the opportunity to think about it.
So let me write it. What does it mean here? So what is that?
Yeah, so let's maybe write in different steps. So it's again an exponential, so you have an infinite series of course.
Then you have this factor 1 over i h bar, this is n, sorry, n.
And then you have all this integration from dt1.
Where here, you want now to consider the time order of this sequence of operator.
Okay, and so here you can remove the time ordering by implementing it explicitly using the integral here.
So here you see that it's always going from t0 to t, and it's going to cancel this factor.
You can rewrite this as- and again I'm going to add a problem in the next tutorial to make you do the first step,
at least to make sure that you see how it works.
So from t0 to t for the last one, but the first one would be right here,
dtn, then maybe t0 to t3, dt2, t0 to t2, dt1, and now it's ordered from left to right in the chronological ordering.
So I don't need the t anymore, because you see that because t1 is smaller than t2,
Okay, so here, let's write maybe the first few terms.
Okay, so writing it like this, I have ordered the value of t1, t2, tn.
Okay, so here what I have is that t1 is less.
Again, you can see that from the integration here. So t1 goes from t0 to t2, then t2 will go from t0 to t3.
So you have this, and then so here I already ordered this sequence of h operator from h t1, h t2, h tn.
Okay, so from left to right. So of course now there are operators, and because there is a time-
if there is an explicit time dependence, these operators are not going to commute.
Okay, so the order is important. Of course, if you don't have any explicit time dependence,
then they commute, so you can get rid of this. You can go around with them, and of course,
This is going to reduce to this simple equation that you're used to.
Am I missing- no, the i is under and here is up with the minus, so it's the same thing.
Okay, so this is a formal solution of-
And yeah, normally I should send you a quiz today, and I will maybe play a bit with which kind of-
Depending if you change your order here, we're going to see that this has the effect that you could have also the other ordering,
right to left, but I'm going to come back on that later.
Okay, so here, as you can see, so we were, as I said, when we quantize classical mechanics using this canonical framework,
quantization scheme, what we get is that we get time-dependent operator,
and a priori, if I want to define this physical object, which is the expectation value of my operator,
my states are not going to depend on time. So this is the Heisenberg picture.
Okay, so here, everything I did up to now is in the Heisenberg picture,
Meaning the time dependence, so operator depends on time, and state do not.
Okay, so this is the Heisenberg picture, and as I said, when you have a mechanical problem,
then you have to solve this kind of equation that are matrix equations.
Okay, so the idea is now, can we go to another picture where the time dependence will be on the state,
and can we directly work with the time evolution on states, so meaning on vectors?
Is that possible? And if it's yes, does it show on our picture? And so to write this explicitly-
Okay, so to write this explicitly, of course the starting point is the physical prediction that is going to be given by this expectation value,
and as I said, this shouldn't depend on the choice of vector or the choice of representation you use.
Okay, so this should be- you should be able to work with any vector representation,
the representation of the vector you want. So now, how do we go to the Schr√∂dinger picture?
So again, this is your starting point, where this is-
So let me be consistent with that, putting h here. So now I want to use-
So let's first use- yeah, so here, more generally, what you have is that A of t-
Maybe I should have wrote it here. So A of t is given by U dagger A0 U of t, okay?
Where u is- so in the case of a time-independent Hamiltonian like here, it's exactly that,
but then you can use also the formal definition here. So for them, this is a kind of formal definition.
You can ask all the questions you want about convergence here, and it's maybe one aspect why
Also, the interaction picture can be interesting, because you can decompose your Hamiltonian in a part that you know how to solve,
and a part that can be seen as a perturbation, and the perturbation can be kind of small,
so you can maybe work with a convergence issue, but here I'm not talking too much about that.
