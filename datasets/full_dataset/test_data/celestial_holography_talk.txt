is naturally starting with initial data on past null infinity.
And then there's some final data for my outstate
future null infinity.
And so I can think about how to expand my metric
or look at the data of the metric near those boundaries.
And so what matters for me right now for the rest of this talk
is essentially I'll be holding U fixed and taking large R
in some of my expressions.
So, if you were just thinking about your Newtonian gravity,
you already expect the metric isn't going to be flat anymore
once you add some matter.
So for asymptotically flat space times,
I'm going to be using the boundaries I mentioned before
and performing a larger expansion near null infinity.
I do that.
I follow Bondi, Van de burg, Metzner and Sachs
and I pick a nice gauge.
So I tried to do my gauge fixing near this boundary
and organize it in a radial expansion.
I have fluctuations in the metric that are subleading
compared to the round sphere metric,
which capture radiative data.
And I have other integration constants that appear,
which the Einstein's equations will relate.
So there's some constraint equations that say how the U evolution of say,
the bonding mass aspect or the angular momentum aspect
are constrained based on matter fluxing through
or the fact that this zero modes of the radiative data.
So basically when I pick a nice gauge choice,
I have some way to organize the components of my metric
and have some sort of physical interpretation of them
like within this gauge fixing.
And I can then have my gauge fixing gives me this one over R
fall offs for these different guys.
And I want to see what is the set of symmetries,
like diffeomorphisms I can do that act non-trivially at the boundary.
So I write down, say, a class of diffeomorphisms
that preserve the one over R expansion of my metric
in my gauge fixing.
And when I do that, I find that there
are these non-trivial guys in the sense of the following.
So I can always do diffeomorphisms of my space time.
But if I think of my future null infinity
as my Cauchy slice for my outstate,
then if I have something that's acting non-trivially on the data
that I'm using to define the state,
I need to be careful because they're basically
a non-zero canonical charge.
They're transforming my outstate.
So these guys that I happen to write down here,
which just as a test, yes, they preserve the fall offs that
are in this gauge are going to be part of this asymptotic symmetry group,
which is yes, it's a diffeomorphism.
It preserves a fall off, but it doesn't fall off fast enough
to act trivially on the data that I'm using to define my outstate.
So these guys are going to be interesting to us.
Basically what's happening is that you have,
what one could try to do is one could say,
okay, Minkowski space, I have my flat metric.
I can do isometries of the metric.
Once I've added matter in, especially,
I say I start adding a point mass,
or I add like other configurations,
I'm going to lose isometries.
But at some point I have this enriched class
of asymptotic symmetries.
And that's what we're basically pointing out.
So in this vector field,
the Y's have an arbitrary dependence on Z.
The F's have an arbitrary dependence on Z and Z bar.
So this is much larger than Poincare.
So we can give them names.
We see that if we consider our symmetries to be this asymptotic symmetry group,
so it acts non-trivially at the data that I'm using to define my outstate,
similarly with the instate.
I can't reduce myself to Poincare.
And I end up with the symmetry enhancement of Poincare.
So for the super translations, essentially for each direction on the night sky,
like a night sky you're looking at, you're looking at the past null infinity,
you can translate the generators of null infinity.
So you can do it independent U transformation,
like U translation for each point Z and Z bar.
And similarly, I can do local conformal transformations,
which are promoting my global runs transformations to ones
where if I pick different patches of the night sky,
it can basically boost and rotate them independently.
So what's going to be fun about this
is that the aerodynamics of gravity
are basically governed by the spontaneous breaking
of these asymptotic symmetries because only some subset,
like the Poincare group that you used to,
will actually preserve, say, the vacuum configuration
if you said I'm in Minkowski space.
But now you have a whole class of vacua
labeled by the super translated versions of these guys.
So there are now two IR modes to be wary of.
And in some sense, this is, like there's a nice connection
between maybe what you might take for granted
is something you'd want to remove from your theory
versus adding them back in.
So we have on the one hand, the fact that I
said that we have these symmetries.
We have these goldstone modes.
I can do a super translation of my vacuum.
And that's a gauge transformation in some sense.
But what's fun about it and part of the reason why I can't eliminate it
is that if I look at, say, early U versus late U,
they will differ by basically a vacuum to vacuum transition
in some sense.
So along null infinity, when you have anything passing through,
So you have a gravitational, say, in spiraling binary system.
And it's losing energy.
And it's losing in your own momentum.
And it's spewing off these gravitational waves.
You're going to see when those waves hit your detector,
there's some amount of energy flux.
And that energy flux is going to induce a shift of the metric
in the same way as you would just have if you had done
a symmetry transformation.
So what happens is basically if you have the same f of z and z bar,
but now that's the difference between the early and late guys.
So you have this dynamical shift, which is another zero mode
in some sense because it's literally like a step function.
It's a very low energy change.
And its symplectic partner is the Goldstone mode,
which is the symmetry mode.
So what I want to point out from this is not only do you
have this interesting phase where there's symplectically paired
and you can't really remove the symmetry without removing
the memory, which is something you can go out and observe.
Memory effects also become a way for you
to experimentally test your proposed asymptotic symmetry group.
So you could play the devil's ad- or I guess it's not that it was obvious.
So the one where you say like, I guess being a Debbie Downer or something like that,
you'd be like, oh, well, you're not really in asymptotically flat space times.
We know there's a cosmological constant.
Why are you doing this?
OK, well, if I say in this region of space time, which includes me
as my like LIGO detector or Lisa and this inspiring binary system,
for some approximation, I would like to think
that I can do physics as if it were like lambda equals zero.
So I can go out and I can say, well, can I see this
or somehow infer this memory mode?
If yes, then I would say that the asymptotic symmetry
associated to its impacted partner
is a physical asymptotic symmetry
that you want to deal with for that description.
So it's, and the thing is, is this becomes relevant
when it comes to other proposals.
So the leading super translations and their memory effect
was something studied a while back,
But I'm going to present for the rest of this talk,
focus on an example, which is a bit newer.
It's going to be important.
So on the one hand, I propose that there
is this way to experimentally test your asymptotic symmetry
group proposal.
But I also want to say that you can go out and see,
does my quantum S-matrix actually obey the symmetry?
And the way that one would do that would
be to translate all of these questions into momentum space.
So I hand you an S-matrix.
And I say, go and tell me, is a word identity
for the symmetry obeyed?
It turns out, and this was a wonderful insight by Strominger,
that you can show that the Ward identity being obeyed
is the same thing as a soft theorem in quantum field theory.
And those were known independently.
So what happens now is you have this triangle of relations.
You have these asymptotic symmetries you want to study.
You have their symplectic partners, which are memories
you can go out and measure.
And you have the way to show that there's a symmetry via the S-matrix
and certain low energy behavior, which is the soft theorem.
And this pattern of connections is very universal.
So as much as I've, when I've been vague,
I've also been appreciating the fact that you could tell me,
do I care about super translations?
Do I care about super rotations?
Do I care about large U1H transformations, et cetera.
I can basically repeat the story for each of the different cases.
And so the paradigm here is that you have some sort of fall offs for your fields.
You see what transformations, whether it's a gauge transformation
or a diffeomorphism, you might want to allow.
And if that is a symmetry, there should be a soft theorem telling you
that it's obeyed by the S-matrix.
And there should be a conjugate memory mode
that can go out and measure and test if it's relevant.
So that paradigm is interesting.
And the point is that it's a template to look for new physics.
So now I'm going to focus on an example where
each of the iterations were very much new in the sense
that the work of Bondi Van de Burg, Metzner, and Sachs is from the 60s.
Weinberg was studying leading soft theorems also in the 60s.
There's a lot of old physics that was recently connected,
which is lovely.
But then you can use this framework to find new things.
So let's see.
First thing to point out is the soft theorem.
And this was something that Freddie at PI and Andy noticed,
which is that the subletting soft theorem
that Weinberg had found for gravity,
If I add an extra very low energy graviton,
actually sends the subleading order.
So you don't only have, say, q's here, scale like energy omega.
I not only have a Weinberg pole for the leading guy,
I also have an order one piece, which is universal.
So the statement of the soft theorem
is just that if I have my amplitude,
and I have an extra very low energy graviton,
So that will change my outstate by adding an extra graviton.
This guy is going to be proportional to,
where proportional means like some linear operator here acting
on an amplitude without this extra guy.
