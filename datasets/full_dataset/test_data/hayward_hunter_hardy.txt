- The next question is
from another student
here at Perimeter Institute.
It was sent in anonymously,
so I'm gonna read it.
The question is,
"You've famously axiomatized
quantum mechanics.
Do you think that a part of 
trouble with quantum mechanics
is similar to the one we have
in the foundations of mathematics,
where we know that there
are a lot of true statements
that are not provable from the axioms?
Similarly, in quantum mechanics,
even though we have a set of axioms,
there will always be
statements in quantum mechanics
that are true, but we can't derive them,
or understand them starting
from first principles
of quantum mechanics, such as axioms."
- So people have thought about this kind of question.
I'm not among them.
There's this very interesting work
the question alludes to on
the logic of mathematics,
and whether that work has
some corresponding element
in physics, and people have
definitely thought about that.
I think it's a difficult question,
and it makes my mind go blank every time
I try to think about it.
I don't know how to begin
to answer that question,
but perhaps somebody who
doesn't have my blind spots can.
I really have no good things to say about,
no good answers to provide to
what is a very good question.
- It maybe requires a new way
of thinking like you said-
- Yeah, I, maybe I'm too old now to think
like that, yeah-
- Great, we have one more question,
and it's from someone
that you know quite well.
- I'm Nitica Sakharwade,
a PhD student of Lucien's
at Perimeter Institute.
I'm graduating soon.
I had a question for Lucien about,
like a broad question about the
field of quantum foundations
as it has evolved the
last couple of decades.
So I was just wondering,
I was, since I have been,
I had been writing my thesis recently,
I was also going through your thesis,
and I was just wondering
what it was like, right,
talking about nonlocality of
a single photon at that time,
when quantum foundations wasn't recognized
as a field in itself quite,
and how you think it has evolved?
In the decades since, like there
definitely has been a boom,
and I was wondering,
so with the rise of quantum information,
and then now more recently
quantum computing,
quantum hardware, quantum software,
all of these things that are coming up,
I was wondering what
quantum foundations has to offer to them, and what are the things
that quantum computing can bring?
What questions it can bring
back to quantum foundations?
- Good questions, Nitica.
So yeah, definitely,
it was a very different
situation back then.
You know, you didn't go
into quantum foundations
if you wanted a job, you know?
It was sort of, you know,
a temporary state of affairs
before you had to find
employment elsewhere,
at least that was the idea,
and nobody was taking it seriously.
It started to be taken more seriously,
I think, with experiments,
so experiments in quantum
optics in particular. 
So already, even before I started, 
Alain Aspect did this sort
of test of Bell's theorem,
and even earlier
experiments have been done
by John Clauser and Freedman.
But in the 1990s, these experiments became
more and more serious.
Leonard Mandel in Rochester,
not so far away from here,
did all these beautiful
quantum optical experiments.
You know, when people do experiments,
the rest of the physics world starts
to take you more seriously,
and these experimentalists
were hungry for ideas,
things that they could test.
So that was a very good
collaboration between
the field of quantum foundations
and experimentalists.
And then as quantum
information came along,
and also quantum computing,
in the early days, the
fields of quantum information
and quantum computing were really,
it was really just a joining of the fields
of quantum foundations
and computer science.
So if you went to conferences
in the subject of quantum information,
then half the participants would be
from a background in quantum
foundations, people I knew,
and half would be people
from computer science,
and it was just these two
subjects talking to each other,
trying to get a common language, you know,
like for example, Ben Schumacher,
who was the quantum foundations person,
came up with the term qubit, you know,
qubit sort of borrowing on the term bit,
which is basic in computer science,
bits at one, or zero.
Well, qubit is the
quantum version of that.
And then once you start
thinking in that way,
all sorts of questions come up
that weren't there previously,
and you know, I worked in the
field of quantum information
a little bit myself for a while.
I have papers on quantum
cryptography, for example.
So this is a very exciting
new way of thinking,
and people in quantum foundations were
in a really great position
to contribute to that,
to the development, and just even the idea
of what that field was.
And more than that, what was happening
in quantum information
and quantum computing was
that you were finding a way
to use quantum weirdness.
So previously, quantum weirdness was
sort of an embarrassment.
It was something that
people hoped would go away,
you know, trying to find an
interpretation to get rid of it.
Suddenly, now quantum
weirdness was a resource.
It was something that you could use.
This is a point that Charlie
Bennett makes frequently
that rather than people in
quantum foundations being,
well, an embarrassment to
physics, suddenly, we were useful.
We could contribute.
That was a great-
- 'Cause you knew
all about the weird stuff?
- We knew all about the weird stuff.
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Just for that reason.
So, and it was a wonderful period,
and when it really wasn't.
It was just an idea that
came from, you know,
marrying these two fields together,
and it was a very, very
fruitful way of thinking,
and so much was possible, you know?
But in those days, you didn't
have to think very hard
to write a paper that was
relatively significant
in the field.
The field of quantum
information has since become
much more technical, and people will build
their whole career in the
field of quantum information,
you know, without having worked separately
in quantum foundations, or in quantum,
or in computer science.
- So the conferences nowadays are
all quantum computing experts
instead of computer scientists
and quantum foundations?
- I mean, that's the impression I have.
I mean, not all, but they-
- Right.
- That's definitely-
- Primarily
- The predominant makeup
of those conferences,
I think, which is, you know, is great,
because there's a lot of
very technical questions,
but I think it's important
still to keep looking
to people in those two
more basic subjects,
because there's new ideas.
One question I think is really important,
and I still think this is something
that we need to understand is what is it
that gives quantum computers their power?
Why are quantum computers more powerful
than classical computers?
And this is a question I remember
when the field of quantum computing
first started to be worked on
that people in quantum foundations
were very interested in.
I went to conferences with
people in quantum foundations,
and philosophers who were very
interested in this question.
What is it that makes a
quantum computer so powerful?
And there's many possible answers.
You might say, well, it's
because of quantum parallelism.
You have, you know,
different, in quantum theory,
you can have different things
happening at the same time,
this indefiniteness I mentioned.
- Mmm-hmm.
- David Deutsch believed
that it was, that quantum
computing was proof
of the many worlds interpretation,
'cause in the many worlds interpretation,
you have all these different realities
being true simultaneously.
And other people thought,
well, maybe, you know,
maybe it's quantum nonlocality.
Maybe the fact that you have entanglement,
and entanglement enables a
kind of nonlocal influence
between different distant systems,
and maybe that's what
powers quantum computing,
and people have working
on this to some extent.
You know, recent work
showing that actually
the advantage of quantum computers,
it does relate back to Bell's theorem,
does relate back to this
- Foundational?
- Yeah, that relate back
to these foundational ideas
of John Bell proving nonlocality.
Another thing that
people have shown is that
it relates to something called
quantum noncontextuality.
I'm not gonna explain what that is,
but it's a very, a basic
idea in quantum foundations,
and there seems to be a connection to,
it seems that you can prove
that quantum computing
is related to that, too.
So Joe Emerson at the at
University of Waterloo nearby
has worked on that, and there was a paper
on the archive today talking about that.
So people are thinking about that,
but I think there's still a lot more scope
for that kind of interaction
between quantum foundations
and quantum information.
- We're running out of time,
but I have to ask, 'cause I've
interviewed a lot of people,
but I've never interviewed anybody
with a paradox named after them.
What is Hardy's paradox,
and what's it like to have a paradox?
- My wife asked me this
question, you know,
"How can you have a paradox?"
And I said, "Well, you can't.
There isn't really any
such thing as a paradox.
So you can't really have a paradox
in physics, or mathematics.
It's always the case
of you're not thinking
about the situation right.
So it looks like a paradox,
but it's not really a paradox."
And she said, "Okay, so I'm gonna call,
invent Hardy's paradox,
which is that there's no
such thing as a paradox."
And in that case, the
Hardy is her, you know?
So she called that Hardy's first paradox.
- Right-
- Zivy Hardy's paradox.
And so, then my paradox
became Hardy's second paradox,
and my paradox, which has
to do with quantum theory-
- I had a feeling it would.
- Yeah, it has to do with quantum theory.
So it goes back to work
I did during my PhD,
and it's really a situation
where you have quantum entanglement,
and you have two systems,
and you can make
measurements on each of them.
I don't want to explain all the details,
but one way of thinking of it,
it's not the way I
originally thought of it,
but other various people
did, is that you can see it
as a breakdown of logical transitivity.
So if you have A implies
B, that's a true statement,
and then if B implies C, and C implies D,
so if all those things are true,
then you would expect
from normal logic to have
that A implies D,
and there's a situation
where that's not the case.
So you can have A implies
B, B implies C, C implies D,
but A does not imply D.
- Sounds like a paradox.
- So it seems like a paradox.
Now, it's only an apparent paradox
because what's happening is as you go
from each of those
statements one to the next
you're changing other things,
not the things that the
statement is concerned with,
but other stuff is being changed,
and so, we can't actually
make those logical inferences.
It's only an apparent paradox.
I mean, I didn't call it a paradox myself,
but I was quite happy to have a paradox.
