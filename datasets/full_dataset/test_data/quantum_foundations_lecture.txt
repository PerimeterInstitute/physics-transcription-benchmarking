Any pure state can be written like that in some basis.
And this provides you with, these are complex numbers, so you have 2n complex numbers.
Okay, that's 2n, but then you need to subtract 1 because of the overall phase, and another
1 because we want to impose normalization.
Okay, so a lot of our intuition comes from the special case n equal to 2, you know, a qubit.
And there's something bad about this special case, we're trying to get an intuition for
the shape of state space.
So let's see, so if n equals 2, k minus 2, which is the, well let me just do all of it.
So that means k equals 4, k minus 1, which is the, I can just do this here actually, let's do it here.
So this one, k minus 1 equals 3, you can check my arithmetic, k minus 2 equals 2.
So this is all consistent because we know that we have the block ball, and the boundary
of the block ball has two dimensions in it.
And then also, if you look at this here, you get a pure dimension that's 2n minus 2 is
also 2.
Okay, so in the case of a qubit, these two things are the same.
Okay, so that isn't true usually.
Let's take n equal to 3, then we have k equal to 9, that's the dimension of the state space.
k minus 1, the dimension of the normalized states is 8, equals, the dimension of the
boundary is 7, but the dimension of the pure ones equals, well, 2 times 3 minus 2, so 4.
Okay, so in this case, these two things are different,
and what that's telling us is that in the boundary, on the boundary of the state space, there's
a lot of states which are not pure.
So unlike the block wall, in the general case, most of the, a generic state in the boundary, that is not pure.
And, you know, it's hard to get a very good intuition about this, but I'll say a few things.
So, first of all, you might think, well, okay, we've got fewer, so here's an example of a
state space that has a part of the boundary that's mixed and a part which is pure.
Okay, but this is the wrong kind of picture for us, because we know there's a continuous
reversible transformation between pure states, so it means you cannot have these kinds of
edges here, you can't have a place where the pure states just stop. Okay.
So this is wrong.
It also doesn't quite fit anyway because this has the same dimension for the boundary for
the pure states as for the boundary states, whereas generically a
state in here is going to be mixed.
Here's an example, and this is not, so here's just to try and get an idea of what kind of
spaces have this property.
So here's an example of a state space, I'll go on to the next board.
Here's an example of a convex space which has some of the right properties we want.
Okay, I can't draw anything on the blackboard that's in 8 or 9 dimensions, but at least I can draw
an example in 3 dimensions that has some of the right properties.
And in a previous version of this course, one of the students coined this as the Pringle
State Space.
A Pringle Space.
So the idea is you take a, actually just to give you a picture because it's hard to draw
even so, take a wire in the shape of a circle, okay?
Okay. And then take that circle and gently bend it, okay, so that the rim of that wire now
is like the rim of a Pringle.
You know what a Pringle is?
It's hard to stop eating them.
So, okay, so I'm going to try and draw that.
Okay, it's not a very good effort, but that's my best attempt to draw the Pringle, the
entropy Pringle.
Okay, now I want the states, the states on here are the pure ones, and then what you do
is there's something called taking the convex whole.
That's just where you take a set of pure states, a set of extremal states in geometry, and
you now find every state you can by mixing.
What that does is it fills out the space into a solid.
I'm going to try and draw that.
Every single, every single, this is a terrible drawing, every combination you can.
Okay, I'm going to stop there because it gets messy, I think you have the image. 
So you fill that out into a kind of solid here.
So, and that's a space, and this space has the right kind of properties because
now the dimension of the space, it lives in three dimensions, the dimension of the boundary
is 2, and the dimension of the extremal states is 1.
It's not the right space, of course, but it at least gives you an idea of the kind of
thing we're looking for.
Okay, one more thing we can say about this situation is, we can just see why if you have n greater or equal to 3,
you have this effect of having states on the boundary that are mixed.
So consider a density matrix, and I'm going to write it in general, this is a general density matrix,
And any general density matrix you can write it in diagonal form, okay, and in some basis,
in the basis of the eigenstates, and then I'll write it down like this.
So all I've done there is I've picked one of the eigenstates, one of the projectors,
and I pulled it out, and then everything else is still here.
Okay.
Now, these lambdas, this lambda is positive.
And if you imagine you're inside the state space, okay, and you start varying lambda, okay, then
that will move you in a straight line until you hit the place where lambda is equal to
zero.
And then you can't keep going if you want to stay in the space, so you hit a boundary.
And when you hit that boundary, when lambda is equal to 0, then the state you have is
this one here.
And this is, in general, this will be a mixed state.
If this is not equal to 0, or at least 2, the entries, then this is a mixed state.
If it's a qubit, then you only have one term here, then it would be a pure state.
So in that case, the boundary states are pure, but in general it's going to be a mixed state.
