Any pure state can be written like that in some basis.
And this provides you with, these are complex numbers, so you have 2n complex numbers.
Okay, that's 2n, but then you need to subtract 1 because of the overall phase, and another
1 because we want to impose normalization.
Okay, so a lot of our intuition comes from the special case n equal to 2, you know, a qubit.
And there's something bad about this special case, we're trying to get an intuition for
the shape of state space.
So let's see, so if n equals 2, k minus 2, which is the, well let me just do all of it.
So that means k equals 4, k minus 1, which is the, I can just do this here actually, let's do it here.
So this one, k minus 1 equals 3, you can check my arithmetic, k minus 2 equals 2.
So this is all consistent because we know that we have the block ball, and the boundary
of the block ball has two dimensions in it.
And then also, if you look at this here, you get a pure dimension that's 2n minus 2 is
also 2.
Okay, so in the case of a qubit, these two things are the same.
Okay, so that isn't true usually.
Let's take n equal to 3.
