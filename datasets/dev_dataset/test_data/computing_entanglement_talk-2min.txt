So quantum Monte Carlo or similar scaling methods, of course DMRG is the one that we
have in one dimension, right?
And so the idea, you know, the idea that we can calculate von Neumann entanglement
entropy in DMRG is well known.
We have direct access to the reduced density matrix there.
So in quantum Monte Carlo, maybe this isn't so obvious.
And so like I say, Max did all the hard work.
And the reason I'm talking about this in the context of condensed matter, I guess, is that
anything we can simulate with quantum Monte Carlo, any condensed matter type system, we
hope to be able to access really subleading corrections to the area law, if you will,
you know, as a resource for identifying new phases, you know, universality at phase transitions.
You know a lot of this came out of, a lot of the motivation behind this came out of the desire to sort
of quantify spin liquids with this topological entanglement entropy.
I guess not all the subleading corrections, okay, not all the scaling of the entropy is
the area law.
As Max mentioned, free fermions, I think these spin Bose metals that Matthew will hopefully
talk about will have a multiplicative log correction.
Okay, so there you can imagine that if we could find a spin Bose metal, you know, in
a Hamiltonian that we can simulate with quantum Monte Carlo, which isn't trivial in any sense,
then we can look for essentially the scaling of the entanglement entropy to identify these
types of phases.
So quantum Monte Carlo, so one of our tools of choice here, really the advantage in quantum
Monte Carlo is that it's scalable in system size.
So modern methods scale as N, the number of lattice sites, okay, and some methods that
we use also scale as N squared.
We consider this poor scaling for quantum Monte Carlo.
N squared simulations can typically be improved upon with clever tricks.
You know, you might be familiar with this, the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo, if
you're used to looking at fermionic Hubbard models, for example, in two dimensions.
These things scale as
