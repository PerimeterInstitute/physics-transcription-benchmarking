Okay, so why we often need Markov Chain Monte Carlo is that in real life these models and
likelihoods are often pretty complicated.
So the constraints are kind of complicated and we can't really represent them in analytic
form.
But you can represent them by drawing samples from the distribution and MCMC is a way of
drawing samples from a probability distribution when you can compute it numerically but you
can't represent it analytically or can't solve it analytically.
