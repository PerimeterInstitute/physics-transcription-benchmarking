is naturally starting with initial data on past null infinity.
And then there's some final data for my outstate
future null infinity.
And so I can think about how to expand my metric
or look at the data of the metric near those boundaries.
And so what matters for me right now for the rest of this talk
is essentially I'll be holding U fixed and taking large R
in some of my expressions.
So, if you were just thinking about your Newtonian gravity,
you already expect the metric isn't going to be flat anymore
once you add some matter.
So for asymptotically flat space times
