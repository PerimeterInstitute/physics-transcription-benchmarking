What are the hardest words to transcribe in the following text: "Have you always wanted to know: What the symmetries of nature are? How black holes process quantum information? What the ultimate UV description of our universe is? Then join me as I continue to develop a new framework to describe scattering:  Celestial Holography.

The Celestial Holography framework applies the holographic principle to spacetimes with vanishing cosmological constant by mapping 4D S-matrix elements to correlators in a 2D conformal field theory. This map possesses a number of surprising features. For example, it emphasizes infinite dimensional symmetry enhancements, which are typically hidden in IR factorization theorems for amplitudes; reorganizes collinear limits as CFT operator product expansions; and mixes UV and IR behavior in a manner that may allow us to make general claims about scattering not obvious from perturbation theory.

Can we show that the UV behavior of amplitudes must be stringy? Can we bootstrap celestial CFTs? Can we unify tools from Loop Quantum Gravity and String Theory?

Maybe, with your help!"
